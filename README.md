# Crimson Core Fitness - Gym Website

This is a complete, production-ready gym website generated from a single-category prompt using a Tailwind CSS-driven frontend. It includes four pages and a README with setup instructions.

Files included:

- index.html -> Home / Hero / Features
- about.html -> About the gym, approach and team
- services.html -> Programs & Services overview
- contact.html -> Contact form
- README.md -> This documentation

How to use:

1) Open any HTML file in a browser to view the site.
2) Replace the placeholder images with real assets or keep the placeholders as templates.
3) Update text content to fit your branding and voice.
4) If you want to deploy, upload the four HTML files to your web server or hosting provider.

Design notes:
- Phase 2 builds use Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid development.
- Fonts are mapped per Gym category: Oswald for headings, Roboto for body (example). The system supports font replacements via the provided font tokens.
- Pages link to each other for a cohesive navigation experience.

Theme highlights (Gym):
- Colors: Primary Crimson (simulated via red tones), dark backgrounds for contrast.
- Layout: Modern, responsive, mobile-first.
- Animations: Subtle entrance and hover effects to enhance UX without distraction.
- Accessibility: Alt text on all images, semantic HTML structure, and accessible form labels.
